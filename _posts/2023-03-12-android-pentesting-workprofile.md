# Active Directory Pentesting Notes and Checklist

### AD Basics 
- Domains
  - Domains are used to group and manage objects in an organization
  - An administrative boundary for applying policies to groups of objects
  - An authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit the scope of access to resources
- Trees
  - A domain tree is a hierarchy of domains in AD DS
  - All domains in the tree:
    - Share a contiguous namespace with the parent domain
    - Can have additional child domains
    - By default create a two-way transitive trust with other domains

- Forests
  - A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees
  - Forests
    - Share a common schema
    - Share a common configuration partition
    - Share a common global catalog to enable searching
    - Enable trusts between all domains in the forest
    - Share the Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups
